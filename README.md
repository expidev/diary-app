# Overview

My project is called diary app. I would like to learn to master the basic and fundamentals of Typescript including classes, types, and some DOM with TypeScript. I am also interested in learning how to use TypeScript with React and Node.js in the future. 

The Diary App is a CRUD application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete diary entries. It is built using TypeScript to demonstrate the language's features and capabilities.

We have the main page which lists all the diary entries, and user can view the button "show more" to see the entirety of it. And show less to return back. We have the Add button to give the user the ability to add a new diary entry. The user can also edit and delete existing entries which are the buttons next to show more.

What I learned is that Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It generally introduces typing constraints either the input and output. It also points out things that might be undefined or null. It allows the developper to anticipate any typing error in the future which strengthen the quality fo the software

# Development Environment

To run this app: we need node.js and npm installed on your machine, the live server extension for Visual Studio Code.

Type `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `npm run compile` to compile application from Typescript to Javascript.

Then run live the index.htm with live server (right click then run live for live server).
